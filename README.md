# Deep Learning Framework from Scratch

> “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” - Richard P. Feynman

The purpose of creating a Deep Learning Framework from scratch is to learn how neural networks work at a very deep level so that when we go back to whatever framework we actually use, be it PyTorch, Tensorflow etc., we actually understand what we are doing. This can come handy for custom problems that require a deeper level of understanding of how things actually work.
